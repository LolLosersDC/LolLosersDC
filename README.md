Yo, if you've ever DCed against me because you got butthurt and were losing, your username is gonna be plastered here for all to see. Stop being little babies and take your losses and learn to get better or get recognized for being the scrub you are. Organized by in game level so you can easily see who's super bad even after putting in major hours. If you're a lowbie and you quit, I'll eventually take you off.

Only Ragequits, DCs midmatch, and noticeably purposeful walkoff on platform fighters make the list.

PS: If you're just here because we played in a match and you wanted to check out my profile, yo! What's up and good games! I hope you brought it 400% and I hope you keep killin' it every day. 

Did you know you can find me on PSN now? Sony thinks that you're too soft to be called "losers" so i my username is "RagequitsAreLame"!

STREET FIGHTER 6 [Rank at time of DC - User Code]:

Update: Hey everyone! It's 11/18 and I hit Master in SF6! Where can we go from hereâ€½ Thanks to everyone for helping me in my Street Fighter journey from Rookie in SF5 to today. Well, except for -

Special shout out to: MegaDeath [Dia 1 - 3409202068] who not only DCed in their losing super animation, but proceeded to name change to "ModCtrls=Sissy" after our match because they lack the ability to self reflect.
